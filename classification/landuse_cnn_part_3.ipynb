        "In this notebook, we will explore the advantages of **transfer learning** for the land use classification task. Transfer learning is a powerful technique where a model developed for a specific task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. In our case, we'll utilize the pre-trained `ResNet-18` architecture, a renowned CNN model. For image classification tasks, the pre-trained weights are usually available from different versions of the [ImageNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet). This is a large and diverse dataset containing millions of images across thousands of categories.\n",

        "The walkthrough part of this notebook will show you some code snippets on how to implement the two main approaches for transfer learning:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Fine-tuning all layers**: This approach begins with loading the weights of ResNet18 pre-trained on ImageNet. By fine-tuning all the layers of the architecture, we allow the model to adjust its learned features more precisely to our specific task of land use classification. This method is highly effective when your dataset has some similarities to the original training dataset but still differs in significant ways. Fine-tuning the entire network can lead to better performance as it refines the pre-learned features to be more relevant to the new task. However, this approach requires careful management of the learning rate and other training parameters to ensure that the pre-trained weights are modified appropriately and do not lead to overfitting on the new dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Freezing the feature extraction layers and only fine-tuning the classifier**: In this method, we use the architecture of ResNet18 with its pre-trained weights but *freeze* the feature extraction layers. This means that the weights in these layers, which have already learned to extract general features from a broad dataset, remain unchanged. Only the final classification layers of the network are trained to adapt to the specific land use classification task. This approach is particularly useful when the new dataset is quite similar to the one used for pre-training, or when the availability of data for the new task is limited. By keeping the pre-trained features fixed, the network leverages its prior knowledge, which can lead to faster convergence and less requirement for computational resources. It's a balance between utilizing the strength of the pre-trained model and customizing it to fit the specific nuances of the new dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Alternatively, we could also **use the architecture without pre-trained weights**, that is, initializing the network with random weights. This usually entails that our dataset is significantly different from the dataset used in the original training (e.g., ImageNet). However, we deem that the architecture itself could be a good fit for the problem, at least for initial investigations."
