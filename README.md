execute
the following command:

```txt
pip install -r requirements/common.txt
```

on your terminal of choice.
*Please note that only Windows platforms are currently supported.*

## Developers & Contributors

To install RoofSense for development use on your local machine, first follow
the [corresponding end-user procedure](#end-users) and
then install the additionally relevant dependencies:

```txt
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
```

[//]: # (TODO -  Link to CONTRIBUTING.md.)
If you are planning to contribute to RoofSense, please see the pertinent guidelines.

## Important (Training & Inference)

RoofSense relies on `torchseg` to build its models because `torchgeo`, its other relevant
dependency, uses `segmentation_models_pytorch`, which does not fully support `timm` encoders.
However, this
functionality is required for
specifying additional
encoder configuration parameters, such as stochastic depth and attention.
*Please note that `torchseg` is *not* installed
automatically due dependency clashes between `torchseg` and `torchgeo`* and must hence be
must be installed manually by executing the following command:

```txt
pip install torchseg
```

on your terminal of choice *after* RoofSense has been installed.
